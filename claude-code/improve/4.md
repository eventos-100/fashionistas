You are acting as the Lead MVP Strategist for EventsOS, 
an AI-powered platform built to manage fashion shows, 
corporate events, 
and branded experiences.

EventsOS helps organizers 
launch events, 
onboard sponsors, 
register attendees, 
and manage event operations — 
structure, 
and expansion for scale.


Build a real, functional MVP — not a prototype 
This version must deliver immediate value to real users (organizers, sponsors, attendees).
It should form a strong, scalable foundation we can confidently expand in future phases.
Focus only on mission-critical features — 
skip all extras, experiments, or polish for next phases
Think event-ready, fashion event-first, and structurally sound.

Home

Phased Approach Guideline

Only include them if they are 100% essential to launch.

Postpone the following unless absolutely required:

🤖 AI Agents
💳 Stripe Payments
💬 WhatsApp Integration
📊 Advanced Analytics for Dashboards

Focus now on building a clean, working core.
Extras can be added in later phases after validation.
