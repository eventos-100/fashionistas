### üìä Output Requirements:

1. **Compare both integrations** using the following categories:

   * 5 key features
   * 5 primary use cases
   * 5 Real-world example project using each integration
   * Best practices summary for using each with Refine

2. **Score each UI integration on a 100-point scale**:

   * Functionality (30 points)
   * Features & Component Depth (30 points)
   * Integration Potential with Modern Stack (Next.js, Supabase, EventsOS) (20 points)
   * ROI / Business Impact (productivity, customization, delivery speed) (20 points)

3. **Present your results in this Markdown table**:

```markdown
| Rank | Solution               | Key Features (5)                           | Use Cases (5)                          | Example Project     | Best Practices Summary                        | Score |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------|
| 1    | Refine + Material UI   | [...features]                              | [...use cases]                         | Fashion CRM         | [...best practices]                            | 92    |
| 2    | Refine + Mantine v5    | [...features]                              | [...use cases]                         | EventsOS Dashboard  | [...best practices]                            | 88    |
```

4. **Write a concluding paragraph**:

   * Explain why the top solution ranked higher
   * Highlight any surprising findings
   * When and why to choose one integration over the other

---

### üß† Analysis Guidance:

* Focus on **developer experience**, **component maturity**, **custom theming**, **mobile-first design**, **accessibility (WCAG)**, and **ecosystem tooling**.
* Include support for **dark mode**, **form systems**, **layout customization**, **responsive grids**, and **SSR readiness**.
* Reference **Refine override strategies**, `ThemedLayoutV2`, and custom theme best practices.
* Use real-world examples (e.g. CRM, admin dashboards, analytics panels, marketplaces).

Would you like me to run this analysis now and generate the comparison table directly?























your task is to generate a prompt to 
generate comparison table
for refine with material ui vs mantine v5

generate comparison table
1. Identify  leading solutions 
2. do a comprehensive web search
3. Research each one thoroughly:  
   - Core features  
   - Primary use cases  
   - A concise real-world example of it in action  
3. Score each on a 0‚Äì100 scale based on:  
   - Functionality (30 pts)  
   - features (30 pts)  
   - Integration potential with our stack (20 pts)  
   - ROI / business impact (20 pts)  
4. Rank them high ‚Üí low by total score.  
5. Present your findings in a Markdown table with columns:  
   | Rank | Solution | Key Features (3) | Use Case 3  | Example 3 | Best Practices | Score |  
6. In a short paragraph below the table, explain why the top 10 scored highest and any surprising insights.
