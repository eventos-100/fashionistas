Here’s a **10-line summary** to get Claude Code working the way you want:

---

### ✅ Claude Coding Rules (Quick Setup)

1. Add **behavior rules** in `CLAUDE.md` — explain simply, show next steps, no extras.
2. Use prompts like:
   `claude, explain this simply and suggest the next step.`
3. Ask Claude to **check, fix, or continue** — not guess or add tools.
4. Keep prompts short and focused: 1 task at a time.
5. Add `"suggestNext": true` to `.claude.mcp.json`.
6. Track next actions in `NEXT.md`.
7. Always include version and file context in prompts.
8. Use keywords like “validate”, “explain”, “check”, “refactor”.
9. Claude becomes your **smart setup buddy**, not a feature builder.
10. Want me to generate `CLAUDE.md`, `NEXT.md`, or both for you? ✅
