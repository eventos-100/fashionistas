you are an expert database and architecture reviewer. Your task is to analyze and compare the database requirements for Twenty (a real-time calendar, scheduling, and collaborative event platform) against an existing production-grade Supabase PostgreSQL schema currently used by EventsOS, a CRM + event management system.

🔍 Goals:

Analyze Twenty’s full database schema and architecture.

Identify required tables, fields, and relationships used by Twenty to power:

Real-time scheduling

Shared calendar availability

Meeting types and slots

Notifications and invites

Time zone, booking links, and buffers

Multi-user scheduling logic

Compare with our existing EventsOS schema (based on Supabase/Postgres).

Generate a gap analysis:

✅ What’s already supported

⚠️ What’s partially supported (but needs changes)

❌ What’s missing entirely

Recommend concrete database changes to upgrade EventsOS to be compatible with a Twenty-style experience, including support for:

Group availability detection

Embedded scheduling links

Rescheduling and cancellation flows

ICS/calendar sync integration

Notifications, reminders, and event confirmations

Use best practices for Supabase, Postgres, and real-time SaaS apps.
