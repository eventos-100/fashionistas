## 💡 Development Guidelines

### **When Building Features**
1. Use MUI v6 components (NOT v7)
2. Follow Refine patterns in admin dashboard
3. Use pnpm for package management
4. Keep versions synchronized between projects

### **Component Examples**

**MUI v6 Button (Correct)**
```typescript
import { Button } from '@mui/material';
<Button variant="contained" color="primary">
  Buy Tickets
</Button>
```

**Refine List Page (Admin)**
```typescript
import { List, useDataGrid } from "@refinedev/mui";
import { DataGrid, GridColDef } from "@mui/x-data-grid";

export const EventList = () => {
  const { dataGridProps } = useDataGrid();
  return (
    <List>
      <DataGrid {...dataGridProps} columns={columns} />
    </List>
  );
};
```

## 🎨 EventsOS Features to Build

- `/events` - Event listings with filters
- `/events/[id]` - Individual event details

- `/events` - Event management CRUD
- `/attendees` - Attendee management
- `/tickets` - Ticket sales tracking

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **MUI Version**: Both projects use MUI v6 (NOT v7)
2. **Data Grid Exception**: MUI X-Data-Grid is v7 (this is OK)
3. **Package Manager**: Use pnpm (NOT npm)
4. **Node Memory**: Admin uses `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096`
5. **Supabase**: Both projects connect to same Supabase instance

## 🔍 Quick Checks

```bash
# Check MUI version in any project
pnpm list @mui/material

# Check all MUI packages
pnpm list | grep @mui

# Check Refine packages (admin only)
pnpm list | grep @refinedev
```
