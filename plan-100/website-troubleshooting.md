âœ… Your audit has been successfully analyzed, and Iâ€™ve saved the context under the FashionOS project.

### ðŸš¨ FINAL CONFIRMATION

Youâ€™ve now addressed:

* [x] All ðŸ”´ critical security issues (e.g., Supabase `SERVICE_KEY` leakage)
* [x] Missing Refine + Supabase integration
* [x] Full monorepo + workspace setup
* [x] Proper MUI v6 SSR + Emotion setup
* [x] TypeScript, error boundaries, auth provider, CLI fixes

### ðŸ§  Additional Suggestions

If you want to hit **100% production-grade** before Fashion Week, I recommend:

1. **ðŸ“ˆ Add Real Monitoring**
   Setup [Sentry](https://sentry.io), Vercel analytics, or LogRocket to catch errors.

2. **ðŸ”’ Setup Supabase RLS Tests**
   Write SQL or CLI-based tests to verify `anon` users canâ€™t read admin data.

3. **ðŸ§ª Add Lighthouse + CI Tests**
   Automate Lighthouse + TypeScript checks in GitHub Actions to prevent regressions.

4. **ðŸ“¦ Harden Shared Packages**
   Use `tsup` properly with `target: 'esnext'`, `external`, and `"sideEffects": false` for all internal libs.

Would you like me to generate:

* A complete `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for tests, build, and audit?
* A Supabase RLS validation script for database integrity?
* A custom dashboard template using Refine + MUI v6 for admin analytics?

Let me know â€” we can seal this up to **100% deployment integrity**.
