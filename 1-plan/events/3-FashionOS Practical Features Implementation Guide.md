## ðŸ’¡ Practical Code Examples

### 1. Quick Lead Capture (Supabase)
```typescript
// /api/capture-lead
const captureLead = async (scannedData) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('leads')
    .insert({
      attendee_id: scannedData.id,
      sponsor_id: sponsorId,
      captured_at: new Date(),
      score: calculateBasicScore(scannedData)
    })
  
  // Trigger email via Edge Function
  await sendLeadNotification(data)
  return data
}
```

### 2. Real-time Dashboard
```typescript
// Real-time lead counter
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .from('leads')
    .on('INSERT', payload => {
      setLeadCount(prev => prev + 1)
      toast.success('New lead captured!')
    })
    .subscribe()
    
  return () => supabase.removeSubscription(subscription)
}, [])
```

### 3. Simple Lead Scoring
```typescript
// Basic scoring logic
const calculateScore = (lead) => {
  let score = 0
  
  // Title scoring
  if (lead.title?.includes('CEO')) score += 30
  if (lead.title?.includes('Director')) score += 20
  
  // Company size
  if (lead.company_size > 100) score += 25
  
  // Engagement
  score += lead.sessions_attended * 10
  score += lead.materials_downloaded * 5
  
  return Math.min(score, 100) // Cap at 100
}
```
