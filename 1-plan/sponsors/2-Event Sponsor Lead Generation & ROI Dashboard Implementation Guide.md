## ðŸ”„ 2. Data Processing Architecture

### Real-Time Processing Pipeline

```javascript
// Supabase Schema for Lead Processing
CREATE TABLE sponsor_leads (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id),
  sponsor_id UUID REFERENCES sponsors(id),
  attendee_id UUID REFERENCES attendees(id),
  
  -- Lead Scoring Metrics
  engagement_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  qualification_status TEXT CHECK (qualification_status IN ('cold', 'warm', 'hot', 'qualified')),
  
  -- Interaction Data
  capture_method TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'badge_scan', 'app_interaction', 'booth_visit'
  interaction_duration INTEGER, -- seconds
  content_consumed JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  
  -- Follow-up Tracking
  follow_up_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  last_contact_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  next_action_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  
  -- Revenue Attribution
  pipeline_value DECIMAL(10,2),
  closed_revenue DECIMAL(10,2),
  
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Real-time Lead Scoring Trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_lead_score()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.engagement_score = 
    CASE NEW.capture_method
      WHEN 'badge_scan' THEN 10
      WHEN 'app_interaction' THEN 20
      WHEN 'booth_visit' THEN 30
    END +
    LEAST(NEW.interaction_duration / 60, 50) + -- Max 50 points for duration
    jsonb_array_length(NEW.content_consumed) * 5; -- 5 points per content
    
  -- Auto-qualify based on score
  NEW.qualification_status = 
    CASE 
      WHEN NEW.engagement_score >= 80 THEN 'hot'
      WHEN NEW.engagement_score >= 50 THEN 'warm'
      WHEN NEW.engagement_score >= 20 THEN 'cold'
      ELSE 'unqualified'
    END;
    
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Data Transformation Examples
