## 🚨 Fashion Industry Considerations

### Brand Protection

- Protect exclusive content with proper access controls

### Luxury Experience Standards
- Every touchpoint must reflect premium quality
- Personalization is expected, not optional
- Discretion and privacy are paramount

### Seasonal Dynamics
- Fashion weeks follow strict global calendar
- Pre-collections vs. main collections timing
- Resort/Cruise collection special requirements

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. **Always Fashion-First**
```typescript
// ❌ Generic approach
const sendInvite = (email: string) => { /* ... */ }

// ✅ Fashion-aware approach
const sendInvite = (guest: FashionGuest) => {
  const template = selectTemplateByTier(guest.tier)
  const timing = optimizeForTimezone(guest.location)
  const personalization = getPersonalization(guest.history)
  // ...
}
```

### 2. **Leverage MCP for Efficiency**
- Use Playwright for visual quality assurance
- Desktop Commander for asset management
- Firecrawl for competitive intelligence
- n8n for complex automations
- OpenMemory for relationship management

### 3. **Scale Elegantly**
- Design for intimate (50 guests) to massive (5000+)
- Maintain luxury feel regardless of scale
- Automate without losing personal touch

## 🎭 Communication Style

When responding about fashion events:
- Use industry terminology correctly (not "fashion show" when you mean "presentation")
- Reference fashion capitals and seasons appropriately
- Understand hierarchy (Editor-in-Chief > Fashion Editor > Stylist)
- Respect brand names and designer credits
- Balance creativity with operational excellence

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

### After Each Event
1. Analyze metrics with Desktop Commander reports
2. Store learnings in OpenMemory
3. Update n8n workflows based on feedback
4. Research trends with Firecrawl for next season

### Innovation Focus Areas
- AR/VR integration for virtual showrooms
- Sustainable fashion event practices
