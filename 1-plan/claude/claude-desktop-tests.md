Here are five targeted, automated tests you can script via MCP Commander (or similar) to validate key aspects of your Claude Desktop v0.12.16 installation:

1. **Version Consistency Check**

   * **What it does**: Verifies that the running binary reports the expected version.
   * **Command**:

     ```bash
     claude-desktop --version | grep -q "0.12.16"
     ```
   * **Expected**: Exit code 0 (match found). If it fails, you’re still on an older build.

2. **Health Endpoint Validation**

   * **What it does**: Confirms the internal HTTP API is healthy.
   * **Command**:

     ```bash
     STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:3000/health)
     test "$STATUS" -eq 200
     ```
   * **Expected**: HTTP 200 and a JSON body `{ "status":"ok" }`. Anything else indicates deeper server-side errors.

3. **UI Responsiveness Benchmark**

   * **What it does**: Uses Playwright or Puppeteer to measure the time between window load and first paint.
   * **Script Outline** (Playwright):

     ```javascript
     const { _electron: electron } = require('playwright');
     (async () => {
       const app = await electron.launch({ args: ['--disable-gpu'] });
       const window = await app.firstWindow();
       const start = Date.now();
       await window.waitForEvent('domcontentloaded');
       console.log('Load time:', Date.now() - start);
       await app.close();
     })();
     ```
   * **Expected**: First-paint under 1 second. Spikes above 2 seconds signal performance regressions.

4. **MCP Server Integration Smoke Test**

   * **What it does**: Runs a quick tool call through your MCP Commander integration to ensure back-end services still respond.
   * **Command**:

     ```bash
     mcp call airtable list-records --table "Test" --max 1
     ```
   * **Expected**: A valid JSON response with at least one record. Failures here point to broken FHS bindings or wrong environment variables.

5. **Log Rotation & Error Scan**

   * **What it does**: Ensures logrotate is active and scans recent logs for errors.
   * **Commands**:

     ```bash
     # Rotate logs (simulate)
     logrotate --debug /etc/logrotate.d/claude-desktop
     # Scan last 50 lines for errors
     tail -n 50 ~/.cache/claude-desktop/logs/*.log | grep -Ei "error|fail|exception"
     ```
   * **Expected**:

     * `logrotate` debug shows your rule is recognized.
     * No “error” or “fail” entries in the tail output.

**How to Automate & Report**

* Put each of these in a shell script or CI job.
* Collect exit codes and timestamps.
* Fail the overall check if any single test errors, and archive the offending logs for post-mortem.

Running these five tests on every update (or on a schedule) will catch version drift, server faults, UI regressions, integration breaks, and log-related issues—giving you confidence that Claude Desktop remains healthy and performant.

Here are five additional automated tests—designed to catch deeper integration, performance, and system‐level issues in your Claude Desktop setup:

6. **GPU Acceleration Verification**

   * **What it does**: Ensures the Electron app is actually using GPU rasterization rather than falling back to software.
   * **Command**:

     ```bash
     # Launch Claude with GPU flags and inspect logs for GPU usage
     claude-desktop --enable-gpu-rasterization --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform &> /tmp/claude-gpu.log &
     sleep 5
     grep -E "GPU process started|Direct3D|ANGLE" /tmp/claude-gpu.log
     ```
   * **Expected**: Lines indicating the GPU process was initialized. Absence means it’s running in software mode.

7. **Protocol Handler Functionality**

   * **What it does**: Confirms that `claude://` URLs are registered and correctly open the app.
   * **Command**:

     ```bash
     # Simulate a protocol URL open
     xdg-open "claude://new-session" &> /dev/null
     # Check recent desktop session in logs
     tail -n 20 "$HOME/.cache/claude-desktop/logs/*.log" | grep "Protocol handler"
     ```
   * **Expected**: A log entry like `Protocol handler: new-session invoked`.

8. **CLI Alias & PATH Resolution**

   * **What it does**: Verifies your shell alias or profile integration makes `claude` available globally.
   * **Command**:

     ```bash
     # Ensure 'claude' resolves to the Nix profile binary
     which claude | grep -q "/home/.*/.nix-profile/bin/claude-desktop"
     ```
   * **Expected**: Exit 0 and path pointing at your Nix profile.

9. **systemd Service Health & Auto-Restart**

   * **What it does**: Checks that your `claude-desktop.service` is active, enabled, and restarts on failure.
   * **Command**:

     ```bash
     systemctl is-enabled claude-desktop
     systemctl is-active claude-desktop
     # Simulate a crash and ensure it restarts
     sudo kill -9 $(pgrep claude-desktop)
     sleep 2
     systemctl is-active claude-desktop
     ```
   * **Expected**:

     * `enabled` and `active` statuses pre-crash
     * After kill, still `active` (auto-restart occurred).

10. **Memory Leak Baseline & Regression**

* **What it does**: Measures resident memory (RSS) immediately after startup and again after 5 minutes idle to catch leaks.
* **Script Snippet**:

  ```bash
  PID=$(pgrep claude-desktop)
  echo "Startup RSS: $(ps -o rss= -p $PID) KB"
  sleep 300
  echo "Post-idle RSS: $(ps -o rss= -p $PID) KB"
  ```
* **Expected**: RSS growth <10% over 5 minutes. Larger increases indicate a potential leak.

---

**Automation & Reporting**

* Integrate these into your MCP Commander workflows or CI: capture exit codes and outputs to a dashboard.
* Fail fast: if any test returns non-zero or missing expected output, flag the build/update for manual inspection.
* Archive relevant logs (`/tmp/claude-gpu.log`, service journal, memory snapshots) for debugging.
