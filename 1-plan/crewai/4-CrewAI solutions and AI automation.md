## **🎯 WHY THE TOP 5 SCORED HIGHEST:**

**CrewAI leads** because it's specifically designed for role-based collaboration that mirrors real event teams - perfect for fashion events where you need specialized agents for venues, models, sponsors, and logistics working together. Its enterprise adoption by Fortune 500 companies and role-based architecture make it ideal for EventsOS.

**n8n ranks second** due to its cost-effectiveness (execution-based pricing vs per-action), self-hosting capabilities for data control, and native AI integration with 70+ LangChain nodes. For a startup like EventsOS, the ability to scale without exponential cost increases is crucial.

**LangGraph excels** in complex, stateful workflows common in event planning where approvals, scheduling, and coordination require sophisticated state management. Its graph-based approach provides the control needed for multi-step fashion event processes.

**Semantic Kernel and AutoGen** round out the top 5 with enterprise-grade capabilities, though they require more technical expertise and are better suited for organizations already invested in Microsoft ecosystems.

## **🏗️ SUPABASE SETUP FOR TOP 5 PLATFORMS:**

### **1. CrewAI + Supabase Integration**

**Database Tables:**

```sql
-- Agent execution tracking
CREATE TABLE crew_executions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    crew_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    execution_data JSONB,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'running',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Task management
CREATE TABLE crew_tasks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    execution_id UUID REFERENCES crew_executions(id),
    agent_role TEXT NOT NULL,
    task_description TEXT,
    result JSONB,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
);
```

**RLS Policies:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE crew_executions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can access own executions" ON crew_executions
    FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() IN (
        SELECT user_id FROM event_organizers WHERE organization_id = 
        (SELECT organization_id FROM events WHERE id = (execution_data->>'event_id')::UUID)
    ));
```

**Edge Functions:**

```typescript
// supabase/functions/crew-orchestrator/index.ts
import { Crew } from "@crewai/core"

export default async function handler(req: Request) {
    const { eventId, crewType } = await req.json()
    
    const crew = new Crew({
        agents: [plannerAgent, coordinatorAgent, analystAgent],
        tasks: await generateEventTasks(eventId),
        process: "hierarchical"
    })
    
    const result = await crew.kickoff()
    
    // Store in Supabase
    const { data } = await supabase
        .from('crew_executions')
        .insert({ crew_name: crewType, execution_data: result })
    
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(data))
}
```

**Integration Tools:**

- Supabase Python client for CrewAI agents
- Real-time subscriptions for crew status updates
- Database functions for complex agent queries
- Row-level security for multi-tenant access

### **2. n8n + Supabase Integration**

**Supabase Webhooks:**

```sql
-- Webhook trigger function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION trigger_n8n_workflow()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    PERFORM net.http_post(
        url := 'https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/event-trigger',
        body := jsonb_build_object(
            'event_type', TG_OP,
            'table_name', TG_TABLE_NAME,
            'record_id', NEW.id,
            'data', row_to_json(NEW)
        )
    );
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Triggers:**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER event_created_trigger
    AFTER INSERT ON events
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION trigger_n8n_workflow();
```

**Success Criteria:**

- 99.9% workflow execution reliability
- <200ms response time for simple automations
- 100% data synchronization between systems
- Zero data loss during workflow failures

### **3. LangGraph + Supabase Integration**

**State Management Tables:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE langgraph_states (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    workflow_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    node_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    state_data JSONB,
    checkpoint_id TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Deployment:** Use LangGraph Cloud or self-deploy with Supabase Edge Functions for graph execution.

### **Testing Framework:**

```typescript
// Test automation reliability
describe('EventsOS Automation Tests', () => {
    test('CrewAI event planning execution', async () => {
        const crew = await createEventPlanningCrew()
        const result = await crew.execute({ eventType: 'fashion-show' })
        expect(result.success_rate).toBeGreaterThan(0.85)
    })
    
    test('n8n workflow triggers', async () => {
        const webhook = await triggerEventWebhook()
        expect(webhook.status).toBe('completed')
        expect(webhook.execution_time).toBeLessThan(5000)
    })
})
```

### **Production Deployment Checklist:**

- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards for all automation platforms
- [ ] Implement error handling and rollback procedures
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling for high-volume events
- [ ] Set up backup systems for critical workflows
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures
