## ðŸŽ¯ **PROMPT FOR CLAUDE CODE: AI-POWERED VENUE REVENUE OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM**

```markdown
Create a complete AI-powered Venue Revenue Optimization System for EventsOS that maximizes venue profitability through dynamic pricing, space optimization, and intelligent booking management.

## Context
EventsOS is a fashion event management platform built with:
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
- AI: CrewAI + LangChain + OpenAI
- Location: /home/sk25/fashionOS/

## Requirements

### 1. Dynamic Pricing Engine
Create an AI system that:
- Analyzes historical booking data to predict optimal pricing
- Adjusts prices based on demand, seasonality, and competitor rates
- Implements surge pricing for high-demand periods
- Offers automatic discounts for slow periods
- Provides price recommendations with confidence scores

### 2. Space Optimization Algorithm
Develop a system that:
- Suggests optimal venue layouts based on event type
- Maximizes revenue per square foot
- Recommends space divisions for multiple simultaneous events
- Calculates optimal capacity vs. comfort trade-offs
- Generates 3D visualization of recommended layouts

### 3. Intelligent Booking Management
Build features for:
- AI-powered booking conflict resolution
- Automatic waitlist management with smart notifications
- Predictive no-show detection
- Optimal booking sequence recommendations
- Cross-venue inventory management

### 4. Revenue Analytics Dashboard
Create a real-time dashboard showing:
- Current utilization rate vs. optimal
- Revenue per event type analysis
- Pricing elasticity curves
- Demand forecasting for next 90 days
- Competitor pricing intelligence

## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema (Supabase)
Create tables for:
- venue_pricing_history
- space_configurations
- booking_analytics
- competitor_rates
- demand_patterns

### CrewAI Agents
Implement 3 specialized agents:
1. Pricing Strategist Agent - optimizes rates
2. Space Planning Agent - maximizes layout efficiency  
3. Revenue Analyst Agent - provides insights and forecasts

### Edge Functions
Create Supabase edge functions for:
- /venue-price-optimizer
- /space-configuration-generator
- /booking-intelligence
- /revenue-analytics

### AI Models
- Use GPT-4 for pricing strategy
- Implement custom ML model for demand forecasting
- Use computer vision for space optimization

## Expected Outputs

```

### 2. Key Features to Implement
- Real-time price adjustments with explanations
- Visual space configuration tool with drag-and-drop
- Automated booking optimization with conflict resolution
- Predictive analytics with 85%+ accuracy
- Mobile-responsive dashboard

### 3. Sample API Responses
```json
{
  "pricing_recommendation": {
    "base_price": 25000,
    "recommended_price": 32500,
    "confidence": 0.89,
    "factors": {
      "demand_score": 0.92,
      "competition_factor": 1.15,
      "seasonality": 1.20
    },
    "expected_bookings": 18,
    "revenue_increase": "30%"
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria
- Increases venue revenue by minimum 25%
- Achieves 90% booking utilization rate
- Reduces pricing decisions from hours to seconds
- Provides actionable insights with >85% accuracy
- Handles 1000+ concurrent pricing requests

## Additional Requirements
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add real-time WebSocket updates
- Implement audit logging for all price changes
- Create rollback mechanism for pricing strategies
- Include A/B testing framework
- Support multi-currency (USD/CAD/EUR)
- Add export functionality for reports

## Constraints
- Must integrate with existing EventsOS codebase
- Use existing authentication from Supabase
- Maintain sub-200ms response time for API calls
- Follow EventsOS coding standards
- Include comprehensive test coverage (>80%)

Please implement this system with production-ready code, including all database migrations, API endpoints, frontend components, and deployment instructions.
