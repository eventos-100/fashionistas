## **Summary: Which is Best for FashionOS?**

**Mantine** ranks highest (95/100) for FashionOS due to:
- **Performance:** Fast LCP/CLS, minimal bundle, SSR/RSC support.
- **Component Breadth:** Covers all dashboard, admin, and data needs.
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase, LangChain, Stripe, WhatsApp, Cloudinary, and Claude Code.
- **Developer Experience:** TypeScript-first, hooks, and flexible theming.
- **Community & Docs:** Active, modern, and well-documented.

**HeroUI** is a close second for landing/marketing pages and rapid MVPs, especially if you want Tailwind-native theming and beautiful blocks out of the box.

**Ant Design** is best for enterprise, data-heavy, or multi-language admin tools, but can be heavy for public-facing or mobile-first UIs.

**MUI** is solid for Material Design requirements or legacy projects, but less optimal for Tailwind/Next.js-first stacks due to emotion styling and bundle size.
