### ‚úÖ Claude Prompt: Expert Website Code Reconstruction & Redesign

> You are a professional **UI/UX designer and front-end developer**. Your task is to **analyze the source code** and **recreate the Tesla Model S website** with clean, modern, and accessible HTML and CSS.

---

**üß† Instructions:**

1. **Analyze the live website**: [https://tesla-model-s.webflow.io/](https://tesla-model-s.webflow.io/)
2. Based on your expert analysis, **recreate the layout, style, and animations** using:

   * ‚úÖ Semantic, accessible HTML5 markup
   * ‚úÖ Clean, modular, mobile-first CSS (use Flexbox/Grid)
   * ‚úÖ Consistent naming conventions (e.g., BEM or utility classes)
   * ‚úÖ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
   * ‚úÖ Responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet, desktop
   * ‚úÖ No inline styles or unnecessary divs

---

**üì¶ Output Requirements:**

* Full **HTML and CSS** code that:

  * Accurately **replicates the visual design and layout**
  * Is **well-organized, commented, and readable**
  * Supports **mobile-first responsiveness**
  * Uses **modern best practices** (e.g., `header`, `section`, `nav`, `main`, `article`, etc.)
* Replace any Webflow-specific structures with **clean HTML and CSS equivalents**
* Include **placeholder content** where needed, such as:

  ```html
  <img src="hero.jpg" alt="Tesla Model S Hero Image" />
  ```

---

**üí° Optional Enhancements (if helpful):**

* Use CSS custom properties for color and spacing tokens
* Add `@media` queries for common breakpoints (`768px`, `1024px`, etc.)
* Suggest animation or transition improvements (if applicable)
* Propose accessibility fixes (e.g., ARIA, tab index, skip links)

---

**üîç Goal:**
Generate a **fully clean, accessible, and responsive HTML/CSS version** of the Tesla Model S Webflow page ‚Äî without copying raw Webflow code ‚Äî and following **modern, production-grade frontend best practices**.

---

Would you like the final code broken down by section (e.g. Hero, Specs, Gallery), or delivered as a single HTML/CSS file with comments?

Let me know if you want me to prepare the HTML and CSS scaffold for Claude to start with.
