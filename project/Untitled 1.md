## 7. Technical Specifications

### Safe Modification Patterns

#### Text Content Updates
```jsx
// BEFORE (Zone Travel)
<Typography variant="h1">
  Explore the World with Our Tours
</Typography>

// AFTER (EventsOS)
<Typography variant="h1">
  Discover Exclusive Fashion Events
</Typography>
```

#### Image Replacements
```jsx
// BEFORE
<Box
  component="img"
  src="/images/travel/beach-tour.jpg"
  alt="Beach tour"
/>

<Box
  component="img"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/[CLOUD]/fashion/runway-show.jpg"

// Safe color override
<Button
  sx={{
    backgroundColor: '#E91E63', // Fashion pink
    '&:hover': {
      backgroundColor: '#C2185B'
    }
  }}
>
  Get Tickets
</Button>

  id: string;
  title: string;     // "Milan Fashion Week"
  location: string;  // "Milan, Italy"
  price: number;     // 299
  image: string;     // Fashion event image
