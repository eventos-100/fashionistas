🎯 Template Adaptation Process
Step 1: Analyze Template

Identify existing components and structure
Map content that needs updating
Note which sections to hide/remove

Step 2: Content Mapping

Travel → Fashion event terminology
Tour → Event
Destination → Venue
Booking → Registration

Step 3: Implementation

Make one change at a time
Test immediately after each change
Document what was changed

Step 4: Verification

Run template locally
Check responsive behavior
Verify no console errors

📱 MUI v7 Component Guidelines
Text Changes:
tsx// Typography updates
<Typography variant="h1" sx={existingStyles}>
  New Content Here
</Typography>

// Button labels
<Button variant="contained" sx={existingStyles}>
  New Button Text
</Button>
Image Updates:
tsx// Image source changes
<Box 
  component="img"
  src="/new-image.jpg"
  sx={existingStyles}
/>
Color Updates:
tsx// Color modifications in sx prop only
<Box sx={{ 
  ...existingStyles,
  backgroundColor: '#E91E63' // New color
}}>
Section Hiding:
tsx// Hide unwanted sections
<Box sx={{ display: 'none' }}>
  <TravelSpecificComponent />
</Box>
🧪 Testing Protocol
After Every Change:

Save the file
Check browser console for errors
Test on mobile viewport (375px)
Verify functionality preserved
Check hover states work
Confirm responsive behavior

Rollback Strategy:
tsx// Always comment out original code
{/* Original content:
<Typography>Old Text</Typography>
*/}
<Typography>New Text</Typography>
