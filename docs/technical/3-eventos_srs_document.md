## 📚 Troubleshooting Framework

### Issue Classification Matrix

| Issue Type | Detection Method | Resolution Time | Prevention Strategy |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Version Conflicts** | Build errors, TypeScript errors | 15-30 minutes | Exact version enforcement |
| **RLS Policy Failures** | Database access denied | 30-60 minutes | RLS testing framework |
| **Hydration Errors** | Console warnings, blank pages | 15-45 minutes | SSR configuration validation |
| **Deployment Issues** | CI/CD failures | 30-90 minutes | Build optimization checks |
| **Environment Issues** | Runtime errors | 10-30 minutes | Environment validation |

### Error Resolution Playbook

#### **Step 1: Immediate Triage**
```bash
# Quick diagnostic commands (run in order)
cd /home/sk/fx/eventos

# 1. Check environment
echo "Node: $(node --version)"
echo "pnpm: $(./pnpm --version)"

# 2. Verify dependencies
./pnpm list react react-dom @mui/material --depth=0

# 3. Check build status
./pnpm build 2>&1 | head -20

# 4. Verify environment variables
./pnpm env | grep -E "(SUPABASE|NEXT_PUBLIC)"
```

#### **Step 2: Issue-Specific Resolution**

**For Version Conflicts:**
```bash
# Complete dependency reset
rm -rf node_modules apps/*/node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
./pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Verify exact versions
./pnpm add @mui/material@6.5.0 @refinedev/mui@6.2.2 -E
```

**For RLS Issues:**
```sql
-- Test RLS policies in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT current_user, auth.uid(), auth.jwt();

-- Test specific table access
SELECT * FROM events LIMIT 1;

-- Check RLS policy status
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

**For Hydration Errors:**
```typescript
// Add to problematic components
'use client'
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const SafeComponent = dynamic(
  () => import('./YourComponent'),
  { ssr: false }
)
```

#### **Step 3: Verification & Prevention**
```bash
# Comprehensive verification suite
./pnpm type-check
./pnpm lint
./pnpm build
./pnpm test

# Deploy to preview for testing
vercel --no-wait
```
