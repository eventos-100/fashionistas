# ⚡ **Expert-Level Recommendations**

* **Map every dashboard/card/grid to a real-world event task:** E.g., “Trending” = “Upcoming Fashion Shows”; “Professional Services” = “Book a Model/Stylist”; “Get Inspired” = “Explore Event Types or Last Year’s Highlights”.
* **Use color and imagery to reflect your brand**—rich photography and pastel or black/gold accents, but never overload the eye.
* **Keep calls-to-action above the fold** (especially for “Create Event,” “Book Venue,” “Sponsor Now”).
* **Responsive testing** is critical; this UI must look great and work fast on mobile.
* **Always show real-time status**: sold out, low tickets, applications closing soon.
* **Provide onboarding for new users**: highlight top features/actions in the sidebar and action cards.
* **Accessibility:** every card, filter, and nav should be keyboard and screen reader accessible, and all key actions should be “reachable” within 2–3 clicks.
