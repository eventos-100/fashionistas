Here’s a comprehensive super prompt that you can use to ask ChatGPT to evaluate the tasks completed by Claude's code, deeply analyze the implementation, identify errors or red flags, suggest improvements, and assess whether the system is production-ready, as well as provide best practices for Mantine and Next.js:

---

Super Prompt:

> I need a comprehensive evaluation of the tasks completed by Claude’s code. Your analysis should cover the following key points:

1. Evaluate the completion of all tasks:

    Assess the steps taken to implement core functionality, focusing on each task and its relevance.
    Evaluate the quality and completeness of each section, particularly the routing (`route.ts`, `checkout/route.ts`), custom hooks (`useAuth.ts`, `useEvents.ts`, `useCart.ts`, `useToast.ts`), and type definitions.

2. Identify errors and red flags:

    Look for any errors in the code such as unused imports, missing type definitions, potential performance bottlenecks, or code quality issues (e.g., inconsistency in naming conventions, missing error handling, or improper component usage).
    Identify any security vulnerabilities or potential for data loss.
    Check if critical best practices, like error boundaries, API error handling, user-friendly error messages, and logging, are fully implemented.

3. Assess Mantine and Next.js best practices:

    Analyze whether Mantine UI components are used correctly with respect to accessibility, responsiveness, and best practices.
    Review how Next.js features like dynamic imports, image optimization, font optimization, API routes, caching strategies, and SEO implementation are handled. Are they properly configured for production readiness?
    Ensure proper usage of server-side and client-side optimizations in Next.js, such as static page generation (SSG) or incremental static regeneration (ISR).

4. Is the system production-ready?

    Evaluate the readiness of the system for deployment, considering aspects like environment configuration, security (CSRF, rate limiting, security headers), and deployment pipeline setup.
    Does the application meet performance standards, with no critical issues that would affect users in production?
    Review the overall user experience, ensuring the interface is intuitive, functional, and stable.

5. What elements are needed for production?

    Identify any missing elements or improvements needed to make the application production-ready.
    Suggest areas where additional optimizations could improve scalability and reliability, especially in terms of real-time data handling and high-traffic scenarios.

6. Provide a comprehensive checklist:

    Generate a detailed checklist with actionable steps for achieving a production-ready state, including tasks for optimization, testing, and deployment.
    Prioritize tasks in order of importance, starting with critical issues like security, performance, and error handling, followed by enhancements for user experience and scalability.

7. Additional improvements and suggestions:

    Provide suggestions for improving code quality, refactoring components, improving state management, and making the application more maintainable.
    Suggest any best practices that might have been overlooked during development and that would benefit the app in the long run.

This super prompt will guide ChatGPT in deeply evaluating the code, identifying critical errors, and proposing necessary improvements to ensure the project is ready for production with the highest standards of quality.

Here's a comprehensive checklist with clear statuses 
for each task, evaluating 
whether 
it's completed, 
in progress, o
r needs to be completed.
 The checklist also categorizes tasks into 
 critical,
  important,
   core, 
   intermediate,
    and advanced based on their impact on production readiness:
