	**Missing Pieces / Gaps** — anything absent but required.
- **Improvement Plan** — tasks & steps to fix every issue.
- **Success Criteria** — how we know each fix works.
Production‑Ready Checklist — tick‑box list; must reach 100 %.

Risk Mitigation & Error Prevention — how to stop future regressions.

Final Verdict — “Ready” or “Not Ready”, with a ≤100 ‑word rationale.

start with #### Duplicate Function Tables
- `DELETE `media_files`) use  event_assets` → 
- `event_collections` → MERGE into `designer_collections`
- `event_designers` → MERGE into `designer_collections`
- `event_sponsors` → MERGE into `sponsor_packages`
sponsor_packages
#### Redundant/Unused Tables
- `` → DELETE (`backstage_tasks`  use tasks
- `session_registrations` → DELETE (use `registrations`)
- `collection_products` → DELETE (use direct relationship)
- `ai_generated_content` → DELETE (future feature)
- `sponsor_applications` → KEEP (workflow table)
