Here is a **master-level, deeply comprehensive prompt** you can give to Claude to generate a full `claude.md` file — structured with **logical flow, real-world examples, user journeys, and best practices** for your project (Material UI v6 + Refine + Supabase + Next.js) powering modern **fashion event platforms**.

It follows a **foundational → modular → advanced** architecture style and includes:

* AI prompt design
* Feature architecture
* Real user journeys
* Integration docs for Claude MCP/Qodo
* Claude-powered audits, code generation, and assistant behavior

## ✅ Prompt: Generate Full `claude.md` File for Fashion Event System (Claude Assistant)

You are acting as a **Claude integration architect, documentation strategist, and developer experience engineer**.

Your task is to generate a **production-ready, modular `claude.md` file** that explains how Claude is used to power development and automation across our **modern AI-powered fashion event platform**.

The system is built using:

* **Material UI v6.5.0** (strictly locked)
* **Next.js 14 (App Router)**
* **Refine v4.57.10** (with `@refinedev/mui@6.2.2`)
* **Supabase** (PostgreSQL, RLS, Edge Functions)
* **n8n**, **Stripe**, **Cloudinary**, **CrewAI**, **Claude Desktop**
* Deployed on **Vercel**, modular monorepo with `pnpm` and `Turbo`

---

## 🧱 Required Structure of `claude.md` (Logical, Layered)

You must structure the file like a **modular knowledge base**. Each section should build upon the previous, reflecting how our platform evolves from core → modular → advanced.
